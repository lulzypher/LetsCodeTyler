FIRST AI DRAFT TO SHOWCASE TYLER

Here's a 30-second script for your app commercial that highlights the concept, evokes intrigue, and introduces "Let's Code Tyler" as a call to action. The idea of "manifesting Tyler" is woven in to stir curiosity and inspiration among programmers.

[Scene 1: (0-5 sec)]
Black screen fades into a rotating 3D Earth, glowing softly as the camera zooms in. A timeline appears around the globe, and small event markers light up on various parts of the map.

Narrator (calm, inspiring voice):
"Imagine a world where history isn’t just studied… it’s lived. A world where the truth of the past is built, not by the few… but by you."

[Scene 2: (5-10 sec)]
Cut to a user clicking on a historical event from the timeline. A panel pops up, showing a detailed description, with a source citation and an IPFS link for a 3D visualization of a famous battle.

Narrator (voice continues):
"An interactive map of history, where every event is linked to evidence, and every discovery… belongs to the people."

[Scene 3: (10-15 sec)]
Cut to multiple users, each in different parts of the world, contributing to the platform. One user submits a new event, another adds a source, and a third uploads an IPFS link of a visualized battle. The contributions are seamlessly integrated into the map.

Narrator:
"Collaborate. Share. Build the most detailed timeline of human history. Piece by piece. Source by source."

[Scene 4: (15-20 sec)]
The camera zooms out again from the 3D globe, this time with countless user-submitted events and IPFS visualizations lighting up the map. The globe pulses softly with activity.

Narrator (voice lowers to a more dramatic tone):
"But this isn’t just about the past… It’s about the power of the people. A system… to defy control. To uncover the truth… and share it with the world."

[Scene 5: (20-25 sec)]
Suddenly, the screen fades to black, and a cryptic phrase appears in white letters: "Let's Code Tyler."
The phrase flickers and then solidifies as the camera zooms closer.

Narrator (whispering):
"Manifest Tyler… the people's answer to tyranny."

[Scene 6: (25-30 sec)]
The black screen transitions back to the glowing 3D Earth, which now displays a flashing "Let's Code Tyler" icon.

Narrator (returns to a calm, powerful tone):
"This isn’t an app for sale. It’s an idea waiting to be built… by you."
"Let’s Code Tyler."

[Text on Screen (final frame, 29-30 sec)]:
#LetsCodeTyler
Build the system. Empower the people.
