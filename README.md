# LetsCodeTyler

Tyler is a system, where a user can choose which Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) ,or lack there of, Auth they are providing with each request on the net.

People should have backups amongst eachother too. Each to help others from losing data.

Instead of building social media platforms the way were doing it is wrong.
Lets rethink of a platform as only the system you load into, that loads your social connections.
Lets build platforms you load from your own device, and it connects with friends and their servers.
Each person, their own host, the barrier of their own burden of data.

Each person will use IPFS servers to help host content.
The general rule should be, if you share content, you should help host shared content on IPFS.

There will be many different aspects of this project. Currently the population is dumb, and meanwhile our government and MEGA corp are building AGI.

What Tyler should be, is a simple platform that people can use, but at the same time become a learning platform for things.
The platform should grow eventually to use technology and put it back in the hands of citizens.
