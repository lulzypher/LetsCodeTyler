# LetsCodeTyler

Lets code tyler in todays age would be a series of DAO blockchains that work crosschain as a means to group up.
Each chain would let their users trade in whatever manner they see, while linking to other DAO like chains to produce a network between decentralization.

Image we build a tyler smart contract. Image that smart contract starts on the monetary blockchains, in order to show people non-monetary blockchain info-sources.
Imagine we use IPFS to make ourselves unstoppable.

How would you build tyler?
Do you have the skills to program an unstoppable network?
We are looking for programers to help us start a revolution.
